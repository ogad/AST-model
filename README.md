# Optical array probe modelling
This package contains a tool to model the operation of optical array probes (OAPs) using Angular Spectrum Theory, in the context of parameterised cirrus clouds.

The project was undertaken during the first year of my PhD as part of a Thematic Broadening Sabbatical.

Examples should be seen below:
- [Processing single particles](examples/ast-examples.ipynb)
- [Processing detector runs through clouds](examples/cloud-examples.ipynb)
- [Generating sample data](examples/data_generation.ipynb)
